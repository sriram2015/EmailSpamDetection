# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

## 🎯 Project Overview
This mini-project aims to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The model is trained using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**, which is simple, fast, and effective for text classification problems.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **sample SMS Spam Collection**, containing labeled messages:
- `spam` → Promotional or fraudulent messages  
- `ham` → Normal user messages  

A sample CSV file (`spam.csv`) is included in the project folder.
